        <h3>About the Experiment</h3>
        
        <p> This experiment is designed to test how giving behaviour is affected by competitiveness.</p>
        <p> The players had either their Generosity Rank, their Earnings Rank, both ranks, or neither on display.  </p>
        <p> This experiment aims to disentangle how this visibility drives giving behaviour. </p>
